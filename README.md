# iTop module : OCS Inventory Integration for virtual machine

## About

This extension adapts the VirtualMachine datamodel so that it can be used with OCS Inventory collector. 

## Download

Release packages can be found on the [iTop Hub Store](https://store.itophub.io/en_US/taxons/all-extensions). This is the best way to get
 a running package as those contains all the needed modules and stable code.

When downloading directly from GitHub (by cloning or downloading as zip) you will get potentially unstable code, and you will miss
 additional modules.
